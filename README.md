# PHP-OOPS
This repository contains PHP code examples that demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and techniques. The examples cover various aspects of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

Contents
The repository includes the following examples:

- abstract.php: Demonstrates the usage of abstract classes and methods in PHP, which serve as blueprints for other classes.
- alias.php: Shows how to use aliases for class names and namespaces in PHP.
- constants.php: Illustrates the usage of constants in PHP classes, which are values that cannot be changed once defined.
- constructor.php: Demonstrates the constructor method in PHP classes, which is called when an object is created.
- destructor.php: Shows the usage of the destructor method in PHP classes, which is called when an object is destroyed.
- funcOverriding.php: Illustrates method overriding in PHP, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.
- function.php: Provides examples of defining and using functions within PHP classes.
- getter-setter.php: Demonstrates the use of getter and setter methods in PHP classes to control access to class properties.
- import.php: Shows how to import or use classes and namespaces from external files in PHP.
- inheritance.php: Illustrates class inheritance in PHP, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a parent class.
- interface.php: Demonstrates the usage of interfaces in PHP, which define contracts for classes to implement specific methods.
- namespace.php: Shows how to use namespaces in PHP to organize and encapsulate classes and avoid naming conflicts.
- object.php: Provides examples of creating and manipulating objects in PHP.
- polymorphism.php: Illustrates polymorphism in PHP, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- properties.php: Demonstrates the usage of class properties (also known as member variables or attributes) in PHP.
- visibility.php: Shows the different visibility levels (public, private, and protected) for class members in PHP.
